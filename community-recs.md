# Community Recommendations
[text]
## 1. Help Newcomers Find Support

In DEI interviews and the [community survey](https://astropy-report.orgmycology.com) it was clear that newcommers have trouble finding ways to get started working with and within Astropy communities. Much of the work of Astropy historically has been the work of software development, but in recent times efforts such as training, lesson development, documentation and community leadership have become new roles valued within the community. Each of these, non-coding areas, is an area where on-ramps and invitations to contribute can be extended in different ways. It was clear that many "users" of Astropy care deeply about the software and its continued availability and are looking for ways they can contribute to that end. Closing the loop and connecting "newcomer" enthusiasm to areas of effort would be beneficial.
