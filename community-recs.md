# Community Recommendations

Our analysis of participant interview transcripts resulted in several community-led recommendations that we feel are valuable to consider when developing new approaches for advancing DEI in the Astropy project. Some of the recommendations echoed themes in Astropy's recent community survey, providing strong rationale for taking action on those points. Where possible, we provide quotes to support a given theme; in some cases, though, we do not provide quotes in order to protect the identities and privacy of the respondents.

## 1. Help Newcomers Find Support

In DEI interviews and the [community survey](https://astropy-report.orgmycology.com), respondents overwhelmingly expressed a desire to improve avenues for newcomer participation in Astropy. Specifically, respondents noted that newcommers have trouble finding ways to get started working with and within Astropy communities. We are aware that Astropy maintains a list of "good first issues," but interview participants were either unaware of the existence of the issue tag or believed the list was too short or specific for most newcomers to find a place to contribute.  

Much of the work of Astropy historically has been the work of software development, but in recent times efforts such as training, lesson development, documentation and community leadership have become new roles valued within the community. Each of these, non-coding areas, is an area where on-ramps and invitations to contribute can be extended in different ways. It was clear that many "users" of Astropy care deeply about the software and its continued availability and are looking for ways they can contribute to that end. Closing the loop and connecting "newcomer" enthusiasm to areas of effort would be beneficial.
