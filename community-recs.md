# Community Recommendations

Our analysis of participant interview transcripts resulted in several community-led recommendations that we feel are valuable to consider when developing new approaches for advancing DEI in the Astropy project. Some of the recommendations echoed themes in Astropy's recent community survey, providing strong rationale for taking action on those points. Where possible, we provide quotes to support a given theme; in some cases, though, we do not provide quotes in order to protect the identities and privacy of the respondents.

## 1. Help Newcomers Find Support

In DEI interviews and the [community survey](https://astropy-report.orgmycology.com), respondents overwhelmingly expressed a desire to improve avenues for newcomer participation in Astropy. Specifically, respondents noted that newcommers have trouble finding ways to get started working with and within Astropy communities. We are aware that Astropy maintains a list of "good first issues," but interview participants were either unaware of the existence of the issue tag or believed the list was too short or specific for most newcomers to find a place to contribute.  

Much of the work of Astropy historically has been the work of software development, but in recent times efforts such as training, lesson development, documentation and community leadership have become new roles valued within the community. Each of these, non-coding areas, is an area where on-ramps and invitations to contribute can be extended in different ways. It was clear that many "users" of Astropy care deeply about the software and its continued availability and are looking for ways they can contribute to that end. Closing the loop and connecting "newcomer" enthusiasm to areas of effort would be beneficial. 

There was also optimism among interviewees that automated tooling could reduce the social or psychological burden of contributing, particularly for newcomers who might be nervous about the quality of their work:

>_There's lots of new concepts happening, but in terms of the actual, like, difficulty of pushing a piece of code and then getting an automated response and then tailoring it before I think the humans really need to see it is you need a little bit of experience and mostly just gumption._ -Astropy maintainer

>_One of the weird things I think is important is also making more avenues for contributing to the code ... From qualitative experience watching new contributors, many times there are people who don't know astrophysics, but who are interested in contributing to the code base. And so, you know, they're maybe not bad at algorithms. Or oftentimes many of them are just interested in like stylistic and linguistic improvements, which astropy was in desperate need of, and less desperate need, but still needs. So we've seen a lot of people that swing in for two, three contributions, supplementing the code. So I think one thing that would be great would be figuring out how, but I think part of it is that non-substantive contribution than ones that are just like to the stylistic beauty of the code. It's a nice itch to scratch, but I don't think it's fulfilling in the same way that, you know, making something, making it something that's a contribution. I think people end up drifting onto the next thing, but it'd be nice if it stuck around. So figuring out how to do that would be great._ -Astropy maintainer

>_I mean, yeah, we don't assign them to anything. If they actually had a very tight PR, so it was well-focused on one issue, then that often takes the form of right here: "Thank you so much for contributing. There are plenty of other of these types of PRs. We have a list of them on our issues page on GitHub, so please take a look." That's if their PR was well-crafted from the get-go._ -Astropy maintainer




## 2. Embrace Intellectual Diversity
Newcomer challenges are exacerbated when the community member is coming from a non-astronomy discipline. 

>_I do find a bit difficult in finding the relevant community because of my different  background. So as I am from AI background and not much familiar with the science or astronomical aspect, I believe that collaboration could be helpful as there are different expertise involved from the collaborator as well as from me, but yeah like there's a lack of communication that I can cite here. The reason is that there are some terms which I may find it difficult ... So due to that, there's not much interaction happening between the between me and the community, which causes some issues while collaborating._ -Astropy newcomer

>_I would like to focus myself on collaborative opportunity itself. If we could have a common forum or something like that which is already available as on Slack, then like people can basically talk about the open problems there and people like me who are much more into the ML stuff or who are not much into Astro can accordingly comment on it ... it's just that we know that we have this data and this is the problem. So how to solve the problem is what we can do. And identification of problem is what, from the Astro perspective, will be needed._ -Astropy newcomer

>_As far as I can see, typical papers from ... a good, a decent journal, all the works there are typically based on very old ML techniques. So again, that's what I feel is causing, I mean, the lack of collaboration is basically what is causing this problem.  Although there can be techniques which can improve the results, way better than what they have achieved, but they are basically unable to because of lack of awareness of these novel algorithms. Basically I go looking throughout those presentations, like particularly from the professors, and by seeing the problem in their particular work there's a substantial opportunity to improve those results. And that's how I had to reach them and accordingly collaborate and work with them on those topics._ -Astropy newcomer

>_So maybe like people who are interested in AI as well as Astro could be given a specific role and they could interact at that specific channel. Similarly, you can say that Astropy can maybe float a Google form or something like that, asking people about their interest and suitably make a Google group or in Slack itself, make a community or make different channels wherein people can join and discuss stuff._ -Astropy newcomer

## 5. Give Guidance to Core Developers and Maintainers

>_I think most astropy maintainers are pretty studious to then present a, um, a friendly face, you know, even if something's quite clearly wrong. When it's another maintainer, you're like, "Please fix." If it's a person contributor, you're more like, "Uh, oh, thank you so much. I see that there's an issue here. There are some ways to address it. Please let me know if you need any help." I think the friendly face is important._

## 7. Use "Buzzwords" with Care

The temperature around DEI conversations has risen in recent years: From business leaders to governments to scientists, not everyone is on board with the idea of intentionally promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in organizations. The recent fervor around this topic has made word choices and explanations of concepts critical to productive discussion. For this reason, community members suggested that Astropy use care and caution when communicating about its DEI efforts. 

This concern cuts both ways. Individuals and groups who are hesitant about DEI initiatives question the rhetoric and language used by its proponents; on the other hand, proponents also hold concerns about watering down the conversation by relying too much on buzzwords, as was the case with a graduate student astropy user we interviewed:

>_It's a little frustrating because at the same time, it is a big issue I think for a lot of spaces. And a lot of communities, but also recently there's been a lot of trends, where people just throw those words around like buzzwords and it's frustrating because it dilutes the whole purpose of, you know, talking about the issues with equity and having the people who are in a community actually be represented by whoever's meant to be representing them. Stuff like that. That's kind of broadly, I think, those things are important and it's not good to downplay._ 

She continued, noting that word choices can influence who ends up in a community and, in turn, what work gets done: 

>_Because it does really influence not only the social dynamics that happen if you're including people, versus you're not being nice, but it also does affect not only the way things done, but what things get done. Because if you have a very narrow definition of people, you only have one narrow group, then the probability that everyone thinks the same way is much higher. If you have a really diverse group, you're going to get a lot of different ideas. You're going to get a much better breadth, I think, of idea generation, things to do. And I think that's something that can be, you know, if you're trying to contextualize within Astropy, if you want a tool that everyone truly can use and everyone goes, "Ooh, yeah, this is the one tool for, you know, Python and astronomy," then you gotta have breadth, obviously. And I don't think you can realistically get breadth if the people who are trying to create that all come from one background and have the same sort of things to say about it._ -Graduate student astropy user
