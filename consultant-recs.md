# Consultant Recommendations

The insights offered from the community reflect both challenges and opportunities that Astropy leadership can learn from in improving the project climate around DEI issues. Below, we offer some interpretation of the community's ideas alongside approaches we've seen work well for projects and organizations who have addressed similar issues. These recommendations are not exhaustive; indeed, our final recommendation suggests that further inquiry is needed that goes beyond the bounds of the Astropy community, ideally in consultation with DEI-specific experts. In other words, future DEI work at Astropy might aim to survey and interview those individuals who are _not_ involved in the community, but were once involved or would be good fits for the project. Likewise, partnering with organizations in the Astropy's broader overlapping environments (e.g., astronomy and open source software) could aid in addressing some of the ecosystem-oriented challenges such as the lack of diversity in scientific disciplines. This approach would be a good step in acting upon the first recommendation: View Astropy as a Catalyst for Change in the Broader Scientific and Computing Landscapes.

## 1. View Astropy as a Catalyst for Change in the Broader Scientific and Computing Landscapes

- Offer the project as a place for diversity to grow in astronomy AND computing, OR either of those things separately
- Map and accelerate the trends in adjacent fields
- Things that are already happening (Summer Research Opportunities, internships, travel funds, etc.)
- Boundaries can be pushed because of university affiliations
- Things that are not yet happening: Equipping underrepresented communities with skills that will give them a leg up
- Relevant trends: Scientific computing skills among undergrads/grads

## 2. Embrace and Cultivate Intellectual Diversity

Intellectual diversity as a mechanism of increasing other forms of diversity

By “intellectual diversity,” we mean “a variety of educational backgrounds, skill profiles, career interests, and computing approaches.” Interviewees pointed out that the project is experiencing an increase in interest from practitioners who are students or experts in fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence (including one of the interviewees, who views himself as a machine learning practitioner first). While this could, at first glance, appear to be a threat to the cohesion and unified goals of the Astropy community, we believe it offers exciting opportunities to invite a wider, more diverse set of community members into the user, contributor, and maintainer groups. 

This is certainly not to suggest that other fields have achieved desired results in the way of DEI; in fact, fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence suffer from many of the same DEI issues as the fields closest to the Astropy project. There are, however, key opportunities:
- Emerging computing fields (e.g., machine learning, AI) often include practitioners from countries that are not well-represented in astronomy 
- Strive to exceed the diversity levels of common fields (astronomy, computing)
- Attracts more funds
- Try to track diversity, but don’t get carried away
 

## 3. Actively Learn from Adjacent Communities


## 4. Be Open to, But Critical of Shared Services

## 5. Consider Geography and Timezones

## 6. Develop Community-Driven Definitions and Metrics for Diversity

## 7. Use _Political Opportunity Structures_ to Drive Change

## 8. Celebrate Progress

- Multiple participants acknowledged and appreciated improvements in the inclusion of women in both astronomy and Astropy. 

## 9. Support the Community Manager in Developing DEI Expertise

## 10. Develop Future-forward Plans for DEI Efforts
