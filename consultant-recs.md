# Consultant Recommendations

The insights offered from the community reflect both challenges and opportunities that Astropy leadership can learn from in improving the project climate around DEI issues. Below, we offer some interpretation of the community's ideas alongside approaches we've seen work well for projects and organizations who have addressed similar issues. These recommendations are not exhaustive; indeed, our final recommendation suggests that further inquiry is needed that goes beyond the bounds of the Astropy community, ideally in consultation with DEI-specific experts. In other words, future DEI work at Astropy might aim to survey and interview those individuals who are _not_ involved in the community, but were once involved or would be good fits for the project. Likewise, partnering with organizations in the Astropy's broader overlapping environments (e.g., astronomy and open source software) could aid in addressing some of the ecosystem-oriented challenges such as the lack of diversity in scientific disciplines. This approach would be a good step in acting upon the first recommendation: View Astropy as a Catalyst for Change in the Broader Scientific and Computing Landscapes.

## 1. View Astropy as a Catalyst for Change in the Broader Scientific and Computing Landscapes

- Offer the project as a place for diversity to grow in astronomy AND computing, OR either of those things separately
- Map and accelerate the trends in adjacent fields
- Things that are already happening (Summer Research Opportunities, internships, travel funds, etc.)
- Boundaries can be pushed because of university affiliations
- Things that are not yet happening: Equipping underrepresented communities with skills that will give them a leg up
- Relevant trends: Scientific computing skills among undergrads/grads

## 2. Embrace and Cultivate Intellectual Diversity

Intellectual diversity as a mechanism of increasing other forms of diversity

By “intellectual diversity,” we mean “a variety of educational backgrounds, skill profiles, career interests, and computing approaches.” Interviewees pointed out that the project is experiencing an increase in interest from practitioners who are students or experts in fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence (including one of the interviewees, who views himself as a machine learning practitioner first). While this could, at first glance, appear to be a threat to the cohesion and unified goals of the Astropy community, we believe it offers exciting opportunities to invite a wider, more diverse set of community members into the user, contributor, and maintainer groups. 

This is certainly not to suggest that other fields have achieved desired results in the way of DEI; in fact, fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence suffer from many of the same DEI issues as the fields closest to the Astropy project. There are, however, key opportunities:
- Emerging computing fields (e.g., machine learning, AI) often include practitioners from countries that are not well-represented in astronomy 
- Strive to exceed the diversity levels of common fields (astronomy, computing)
- Attracts more funds
- Try to track diversity, but don’t get carried away
 

## 3. Actively Learn from Adjacent Communities

There is a rich ecosystem of organizations supporting open source scientific software and open source scientific communities. Some of these communities have experienced many of the same challenges that Astropy is experiencing. Looking at these communiteis, th

## 4. Be Open to, But Critical of Shared Services

**NOT SURE THIS IS WHAT YOU MEAN HERE DAN, but taking a stab anyway...**
With community members already busy with considerable commitments in many areas, software, day-jobs, career advancement, it can be tempting to consider shared services models for some core community activities. One example of this is the idea of a fiscal sponsor (NumFOCUS) for example bringing the work of organizing and maintaining a Code of Conduct enforcement committee for all fiscally sponsored projects of the organization. This could be compelling, but it could also lead to the commnuity losing touch with its own self-work to improve itself and address root-causes of Code of Conduct incidents. Finding a balance where the community can collectively hold its enforcement, and have enabling infrastructure and guidance that makes it "lightweight" to do so are what we'd recommend for a growing community like Astropy. 

## 5. Consider Geography and Timezones

It was clear from the communnity survey that there is a dominant gravity for timezones in North America. This  can lead the community to make decisions about meeting times that are difficult for those in other global timezones to feel included in the conversations about DEI issues. Astropy is alredy a very asynchronous community, but in its synchronous moments, it could be useful to bring more consideration to those in minority timezone areas. Additonally, when key annual events are held in the USA, there can be very restrictive visitation visa restrictions for travel to the United States for people from some locales. It can be worthwhile to consider annual events taking place each year in countries with less restrictive visa requirements. 

## 6. Develop Community-Driven Definitions and Metrics for Diversity

The Astropy community should work to collectively define its own targets and progress benchmarks for increasing and expanding diversity as a community. It is clear that the Astronomy community at-large still has siginificant DEI issues, and it is also clear that many in the Astropy community aspire for it to challenge those trends with a new model of working and including others. For this to be successful, it will be important for the leadership of Astropy to be the ones defining what DEI looks like for Astropy, no consultant recommentdations can fill-in for frank and open community converstaions. We encourage Astropy community members to continue to advocate for finding the time and space to have these conversations, and bring the conversations toward key measurable goals for the community. 

## 7. Use _Political Opportunity Structures_ to Drive Change

Consider what structures exist within the field of astronomy to encourage change. What other efforts are ongoing within the field that could lead to more diversity and inclusion? Where are others in astronomy already having discussions about equity that Astropy could engage with? 

## 8. Celebrate Progress
It is important when working on challenging topics like DEI to celebrate strides in the community and improvements as they occur. 

- Multiple participants acknowledged and appreciated improvements in the inclusion of women in both astronomy and Astropy.
- What additional progress could we make small but measurable impact on? 

## 9. Support the Community Manager in Developing DEI Expertise

Given that DEI is an issue in the community, giving support to the Community Manager as a part of their work and resources to learn more about DEI and to work with other scientific organizations that are struggling with the same challenges is a way of creating more astronomy centered knowledge on the topic. 

## 10. Develop Future-forward Plans for DEI Efforts

Thinking towards the future of DEI for Astropy would include an ongoing discussion of what the community would like to see going forward and how to continue to make these efforts a community conversation. 

- plans could include future thinking exercises around DEI
- Events on the topic, such as meetings or structured conversations.
