## Abstract

This report synthesizes community-driven recommendations derived from a comprehensive analysis of participant interviews, aiming to inform and enhance Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) practices within the Astropy project. The feedback from the community reflects a shared concern for increasing newcomer engagement and supporting a broader definition of valuable contributions beyond traditional software development.

A common thread highlights the need for explicit support systems to help new members, including those from non-astronomy disciplines, integrate into Astropy. Participants advocate for strategies such as better advertising "good first issues", expanding non-code roles like training and lesson development, and leveraging automated tooling to streamline initial contributionsâ€”bringing diverse expertise into the community dialogue, including individuals from the AI/ML sectors.

Suggestions also emphasize the importance of embracing intellectual diversity and learning from successful models in analogous communities. Astropy is encouraged to recognize and cultivate positive trends, such as impactful role models, and to offer clear guidance to maintainers for fostering an inclusive atmosphere. Furthermore, the report stresses cautious use of DEI terminology to prevent undermining genuine progress and advises a careful approach to communicate these efforts effectively. Other key recommendations include establishing transparent community roles, encouraging safe feedback channels, creative enforcement of the Code of Conduct, and nurturing healthy cross-disciplinary collaborations.

The insights gathered underscore the presence of latent potential within the Astropy community, to not only enhance DEI efforts but also to enrich the project's output through the inclusion of a variety of perspectives and skills in the pursuit of collective goals.
